## Project Description

The "Evolutionary World Simulation" is a simulation of the Darwinian world. The world consists of savannahs and jungles with plants and animals that eat, reproduce, and evolve over millions of years. Each animal has its own genotype, behavior, anatomy, reproduction method, consumption, and mutation. The application is built using JavaFX and allows for running simulations with different configurations, displaying animations with animal positions, their energy levels, plant positions, and tracking various simulation statistics. Parameters of the animals, maps and plants are loaded from the file so then can be adjusted in various ways. The main goal for the animals is to survive and pass on their genotype - only the strongest animals will survive.

### Parameters:

- heightOfMap

- energyRequiredToReproduce
- energyUsedToMakeChild
- minNumberOfMutations
- maxNumberOfMutations
- mutationSelection
- lengthOfGenotype

In addition, author's music was added to the project, which makes time more pleasant while admiring the world of virtual animals and plants :)
